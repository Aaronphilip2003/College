if you give an input 45 it will be entered as [34,35,"ascii value of enter key"],
ASCII value of 4 is 34
ASCII value of 5 is 35
if you press enter the ASCII value of the enter key will also get saved
we need to convert 34 and 35 to 4 and 5
rotate operation is performed bit by bit
rotate 04 we will get 40 then add 5
steps first subtract 30 or 37, then rotate the higher digit and add the lower digit
34 35 --> 04, 05 -->rotate higher digit (MSB digit and LSB digit) ---> 40,05---> add them ----> therefore ans is 45

mov ax,[num]
cmp ah,3h
jbe l2 ; jump below or equal to
sub ah,07h


l2: sub ah,39h
rol ah,4
cmp al,39h
jbe l3
sub al,07h

l3: sub al,30h
add ah,al
